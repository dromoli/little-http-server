LITTLE HTTP SERVER - DESIGN NOTES
=================================

These brief document explains some design decisions and what is missing at this stage.

Design notes
------------

The server will listen on the specified port for incoming connections. The port can be supplied as a JVM argument at
the command line. Failing to do so will make the server run on a default port (8080). There were a number of options
for implementing this (a properties file, arguments to the main method, etc). Being only one value, I considered the
properties file an overkill, whereas the argument to the main method was a more interesting option. I favoured the
JVM argument as it can be accessed anywhere in the system instead of only inside the main method as the other option
(even though we do not do that at this stage).

The server is implemented mostly in one class, with 2 helper classes. These were used to declutter the code a bit in
the main class although it is debatable whether this is actually helpful in this simple case.

The processRequests(String request) method in the LittleHttpServer class has the most interesting logic. It mainly
determines whether a File is a directory or a regular file and, depending on that, returns an appropriate response. If
it is dealing with a directory, it first adds navigation links to the response. These are used to go back to the root
directory (.) or one level up (..). Then, it gets the list of files and dirs inside the current directory, sorts them
out (directories first) while providing format and hrefs for the links that will be displayed. Alternatively, if it is
dealing with a file, it reads and returns the file's content so that it can be written to the socket output stream.
Navigation is interrupted when viewing a file, making it necessary for the user to hit the back button in order to
return to the app logic.


Caveats
-------

The server at this stage only returns text files (not binary files). Problably we could decide whether to write binary
content vs text content based on the result of Files.probeContentType().

The display page does not allow column sorting. This would require better page formatting to begin with and then
handling a few more URLs and different sorting lambdas/comparators to cover each case.


Conclusion
----------

This has been a fun and rather enlightening exercise. It made me refresh some Socket basics along with reminding me to
what extent our work is simplified by web frameworks these days.
